                            Hello, world! I'm Johnson, a Computer Science
                            graduate from San Francisco State University based
                            in San Francisco, CA. Having a strong experience in
                            technical troubleshooting and a knack for
                            problem-solving, has helped me create some amazing
                            things. I enjoy building things that live on the
                            internet and love exploring new technologies. I'm
                            currently seeking a role as a Full Stack or Backend
                            Engineer.
                            <br></br>
                            <br></br>
                            Aside from my tech-savvy self, I enjoy finding and
                            listening to music. In my downtime, I would relax by
                            queueing up tracks and mixing them together. Yes,
                            I'm also a DJ! When I'm not in my developer or DJ
                            shoes, I'm looking at collecting shoes. Fun fact, I
                            currently own 80+ pairs of sneakers ðŸ¤¯
